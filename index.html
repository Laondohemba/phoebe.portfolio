                      <p class="card-text">Coming from the 1900s when a group of researchers solved the frustrations researchers had with technology, which included its limited accessibility.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Down to the 21st century, the internet has become easy to access and a part of the lives of every individual.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">But, you know that popularly saying, 'all good things have a downside'. In this article, I will be sharing tips on how to stay safe online.</p>
                        
                    <strong class="card-title">PRIVACY.</strong>
                    <p class="card-text">Keeping information like your address, how much you earn, and even relationship status should be a priority when using the internet.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Desist sharing your credit or debit card details on unverified or suspicious websites to avoid being scammed.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Hangout locations, sensitive information about your job and even photos of kids are advised to be kept private.</p>
                        
                    <strong class="card-title">SUSPICIOUS EMAILS/APPS.</strong>
                        
                    <p class="card-text">Phishing is a method hackers and identity thieves use to steal data by asking you to download an attachment through email.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">When clicked on, this gives them all data they need which can be used for fraudulent purposes under your identity.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Apps gotten from third party senders can carry malware when installed on your phone, so it is advised to get antivirus software or avoid it totally.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Also suspicious, emails and even text messages, should not be opened but completely deleted.</p>
                        
                    <strong class="card-title">UNIQUE AND EASY TO REMEMBER PASSWORDS.</strong>
                    <p class="card-text">To be discreet with your business online, having a strong password of not more than 16 characters with numbers and signs included.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Your password should be easy to remember too and one password should be used for different things. This is because if apps get hacked, your information is not safe.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">It is advisable to use a password manager tool to generate unique and strong passwords, if you can't.</p>
                    <p class="card-text"> <strong>BONUS:</strong> The multifactor authentication can be an added advantage to help secure your identity, after your password. It reduces the likelihood of being hacked.</p>
                        
                    <p class="card-text">In conclusion, we can not disagree that the internet has become an intricate part of our lives, but we also have to do our own part, which also means keeping our own space safe.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">Our personal information, addresses, should be kept private, alongside creating strong passwords and avoiding suspicious mails and text messages.</p>

                      <p class="card-text">Freelancing has become popular by the day, even though it has been in existence before.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">In a world of 8.2 billion people, freelancers around the planet have been estimated to be around 1.54 billion people, according to Statista.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">However, it is no news that once you are in this industry, you're in charge of everything you do from scheduling your day to fixing appointments.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">In this article, I will be sharing five unique apps that aid your daily life from time management to receiving payment.</p>
                      
                      <strong>LinkedIn</strong> 
                      <p class="card-text">The first app you need is the LinkedIn app for job and business news. It is the most effective in getting or landing a good paying job, aside from being the worldâ€™s biggest professional network.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Its founders aim to create opportunities for every member of its global workforce.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">The app helps you build your presence while you network with colleagues in your industry, reach out to recruiters, or the other way around.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Unarguably, the LinkedIn platform has been an advantage to the professional world in the 21st century, having about 1 billion users in over 200 countries and territories, according to LinkedIn.com.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">To start, download the app or go to the LinkedIn sign-up page, input your name and email address, and that is it.</p>
                      
                      <strong>CLOCKIFY</strong>
                      <p class="card-text">Clockify is a free online time tracking software. It allows the user to monitor and manage time on projects when the timer is turned on from your start time.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">With an inclusion of a timesheet, timers, worksheet and calendar, it makes the software seemless and effective.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">The timesheet allows you to balance the workload on different projects. It also helps enhance effectiveness.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Navigating clockify is easy as it can be installed on mobile devices and desktops. To sign up, you just need an email address and you are in.</p>

                      <strong>Trello</strong>
                      <p class="card-text">Trello is a project management tool that is used for collaborating mostly with a team. It can be utilized to organize and keep track of projects.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">With this software, information about your work and whether it is making advancement or not can be accessed.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Interestingly, the user-friendly app makes it easy for team members as you can comment, deadlines, and even attachments. Trello can be accessed on both mobile and desktop devices.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">However, Trello can be said to be free even with a premium subscription option because almost all of its features can be accessed from the free version.</p>

                      <strong>Google drive.</strong>
                      <p class="card-text">Another important app to have as a freelancer is Google Drive. This is a cloud storage provider that backs up your file outside your system but on a Google server with its 15GB storage space.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">It allows you to access any file in any country of the world, with just an internet connection. Google Drive makes it easy to share and work on files with colleagues by just sending a link.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">An additional feature that makes this app interesting, is its search function that makes it effortless when searching for a file, even with the tiniest information.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">It can be navigated on mobile devices and desktops.</p>
                      
                      <strong>PayPal</strong>
                      <p class="card-text">PayPal is a quick and easy fintech app that allows you to send and receive money after signing up with just an email address.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">After signing up, you have an option of choosing either a personal or business account to provide the best services to its users.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">Binding and linking your credit or debit cards finalizes your Paypal journey.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">This reveals how user-friendly the digital wallet is.</p>
                      <p class="card-text">In conclusion, these apps, which cover job hunting, and time management down to receiving payment,will make your freelance journey easier than you think.</p>
